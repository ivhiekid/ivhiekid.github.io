**The Impact of Natural Disasters on Capital Flows: The effect of Preparedness and Disaster Risk**

*-available at request*

Climate-change-induced disasters have increased significantly over the past decade, heightening physical risks that can affect financial markets. This paper explores the impact of both domestic and foreign natural disasters on international capital flows, which are key contributors to financial markets, and examines the heterogeneous reactions of flows across countries. I show that capital flows react significantly to natural disasters when controlling for previously unexamined factors, such as a country’s preparedness to handle disasters and disaster risk level. I further analyze different reactions of capital flows. I find that portfolio equity flows react more negatively to domestic disasters, while debt flows are more sensitive to foreign disasters. FDI and bank flow reactions are more muted. Moreover, the results show that flows react significantly to disasters when the severity of the impact is measured in terms of population exposure rather than the duration of the event.

**Deleveraging and Foreign Currency Loan Conversion Programs in Europe**

*-joint with* [*Pınar Yeşin*](https://www.pinaryesin.com/), [*Comparative Economic Studies*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00116-1)

This paper first reviews the developments in the size and composition of the European banking sectors’ balance sheets since the Global Financial Crisis and then assesses the impact of foreign currency loan conversion programs on systemic risk. Aggregate data from 2009Q1 to 2019Q3 indicate three major developments. First, the deleveraging process in Europe has been sizeable, while credit growth may be hampered in several countries. Secondly, macroprudential measures and conversion programs have only partially achieved their goal of lowering financial dollarization in Central and Eastern Europe. Lastly, systemic risk remains elevated in the non-euro area.
